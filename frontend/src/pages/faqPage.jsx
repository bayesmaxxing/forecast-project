          <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>FAQ 1: Why are you doing this?</Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            I want to make my beliefs match reality as much as possible. To make this happen, this public forecasting project is 
            a vital part. Now, my track record is visible to anyoneâ€”giving me an incentive to perform at my best in my forecasts.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Eventually, I would like to add comments and the ability for readers to challenge my beliefs. Until then, you can 
            reach out to me with a question or challenge.

          <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>FAQ 2: How are the scores you use defined?</Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            I use three different scoring rules: (i) Brier score, (ii) Binary Log score, and (iii) Natural Log score.
            They are defined as follows.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            (i) Brier score, when applied to one-dimensional forecasts, is the mean squared error of a forecast. This score is 
            minimized, so a score closer to 0 is better. A maximally uncertain prediction of 50% would yield a Brier score of 0.25.
          </Typography>
          <Box sx={{ my: 2, textAlign: 'center' }}>
            <Latex>{`$${brierScoreString}$`}</Latex>
          </Box>
          <Typography paragraph>
            (ii) Binary Log Score and (iii) Natural Log score are equivalent to the negative of Surprisal, a 
            commonly used scoring criterion in Bayesian inference. Compared to Brier score, these scores are harsher on poor
            predictions that are closer to 0 and 1. These scores are maximized, so a prediction scoring -0.10 is better than a 
            prediction scoring -0.8.
          </Typography>
          <Box sx={{ my: 2, textAlign: 'center' }}>
            <Latex>{`$${logScoreString}$`}</Latex>
          </Box>
          <Typography paragraph>
            This is a local strictly proper scoring rule under any base larger than 1. Given a binary prediction, the logarithmic 
            scoring rules can be rewritten as:
          </Typography>
          <Box sx={{ my: 2, textAlign: 'center' }}>
            <Latex>{`$${logScoreString2}$`}</Latex>
          </Box>
          <Typography>
            Where x is the outcome of the event and p is the expressed probability.

        <Paper sx={sectionStyle}>
          <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>FAQ 3: What is a proper scoring rule?</Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A proper scoring rule is rule which, when implemented, incentivizes forecasters to report their True beliefs when forecasting.
            Mathematically, this means that a forecaster which maximizes reward will report the true probability distribution when they know the true
            probability distribution.

          <Typography paragraph>
            Apart from design improvements and small features, such as free text search. I'm planning some larger features:
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            (1) Include statistical models with my forecasts. I'm planning for this to be a link to a Google colab notebook or similar.

          <Typography paragraph>
            (2) Comment section and Suggestion box for Users.

          <Typography paragraph>
            (3) Blog posts.

            Of course, anyone can do forecasting.

          <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>FAQ 7: Why are many of the questions and predictions made on 2023-10-16?</Typography>
          <Typography>
            Before starting the project, I did not track the timing of my forecasts. To have a time of creation for all questions and predictions, 
            I set the time to the date I migrated my forecasts to the new database.
