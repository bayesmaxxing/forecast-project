### Samuel's Forecasts
I built this web app to display my forecasts, to improve my forecasting skills, and to make my forecasts more public. More than that, it's been a project to learn about software development. It is a simple project really. I use postgres to store all data. For the backend, I use Golang and for the frontend, I use React.
