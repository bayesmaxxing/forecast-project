### Forecaster
This project was built to accomodate my forecasting practice. To make my forecasts more public, and thus making me more accountable, I built this web app. 

Forecast questions, forecast points, and resolutions are stored in a database which serves a Django Rest API. A React frontend serves the data to users. 

visit samuelsforecasts.com to see the web app.
